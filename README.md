# kineticSynth
KineticSynth (2019) is a musical app for the iOS platform controlled via the device's accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. It was a proof-of-concept, just like its predecessor yossBeats (2010), which was controlled via the accelerometer only. Due to requests by fellow musicians, I publish (the important part of) the source code here. You can do anything you like with it (MIT license).
The approach of the app is fairly minimalistic - no UI components, no 3rd party libs, the bare minimum to have a functioning app, just something to experiment with.
